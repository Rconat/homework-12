# homework-12

## Description 

The purpose of this assignment is to take an existing webpage and modify the code without changing the overall look of the website. The changes made to the website should have an emphasis on accessability as well as code optimization.

This is very useful to provide a good work flow for improving existing websites and make them more accessible for a wider audience. 

The webpage is hosted on [GitHub](https://rconat.github.io/homework-12/).

You can find the repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/Rconat/homework-12/).

## Usage 

This assignment provides a good example of how accessibility can be implemented on any existing website. Following the commits within this project you can easily see a step by step process for improving specific elements to make sure they are easily understood and designed with accessibility in mind. This can also be used to show how multiple CSS selectors with the same styles can be combined for easier coding practices.

## Credits

For this assignment I used https://contrastchecker.com/ to make sure that all of the background/foreground combinations were optimized for the visually impared.
